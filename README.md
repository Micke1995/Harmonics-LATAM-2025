The novelty of this investigation lies in the power system harmonic identification powered by the ERA method. This approach consists of a system identification technique that allows us to design a filter bank for extracting harmonic components from actual or simulated data, being more flexible and adaptable than the Fourier filters which take into account only a fixed frequency. The ERA filter bank is also able to provide damping and frequency estimates, giving more useful information than Fourier. Thus, the primary contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:


- The estimation achieved by the ERA method allows us to correctly extract harmonics, inter-harmonics, and sub-harmonics from actual or simulated data.

- The proposed method extends the state-of-the-art of parametric/model-based methods by introducing the ERA technique.

- Dynamic modeling: Moves away from static paradigms by employing a dynamic model that captures time-varying harmonic patterns.

- A powerful tool for processing harmonic estimations based on a set of ERA-based FIR filters is proposed to power system community.
